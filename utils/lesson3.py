# Note the different update order may lead to very different stable states (again, look at the case of the bipartite graph).

# Above models are essentially deterministic models (except, for example, for the random selection of thresholds).

# The advantage of these models is that they allow "wrong" choice, that may be realistic, and useful to escape from bad unrealistic equilibria.
#
# Note that this dynamics does not terminates, unless either all nodes are active, or all nodes are not.
# For this reason we only run a limited number of steps.

#The following greedy algorithms returns a set of seeds of size budget such that
#the (expected) number of active nodes at the end of the dynamics is a good approximation (namely, 1-1/e)
#of the maximum (expected) number of nodes that would be achieved by the best seed set of size budget,
#whenever the dynamics satisfies the following two properties:
#- Monotony: the (expected) number of active nodes at the end of the dynamics increases as the number of seed nodes increase;
#- Submodularity: the marginal contribution of a seed node (i.e., how much it increases the number of active nodes at the end of the dynamics)
#                 is larger when this seed node is added to a small seed set than when it is added to a large seed set.
